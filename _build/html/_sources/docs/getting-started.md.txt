# Pollinations API

Welcome to the Pollinations API!

In this document, you will learn how to use the Pollinations API in order to create AI generated medias. There are three ways to interact with the API:
- the REST API
- the websocket API
- the python sdk 'pypollsdk' (alpha)

For all use cases, you need a JWT to authenticate your requests. In order to obtain this token, please get in touch with us via <hello@pollinations.ai> or join our [discord](https://discord.gg/vByA9cVf)
