Welcome to pollinations-api's documentation!
============================================

In this document, you will learn how to use the Pollinations API in order to create AI generated medias. There are three ways to interact with the API:
- the REST API
- the websocket API
- the python sdk 'pypollsdk' (alpha)

For all use cases, you need a JWT to authenticate your requests. In order to obtain this token, please get in touch with us via <hello@pollinations.ai> or join our [discord](https://discord.gg/vByA9cVf)
